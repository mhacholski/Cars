			<h2>Ford Mustang Shelby GT350R</h2>
				<p>Ford’s Shelby Mustang GT350R is one of the finest automobiles I have ever seen. This beauty contains a 5.2-liter V-8 engine. Ford has taken a hint from Chevrolet and redesigned the back of the car. It has more the bulky look of the Chevy Camaro, which makes it sexy! But it is not just the sexy sleekness of its design that gets us going, it’s also a well-crafted car under the hood. The GT350R contains a 5.2-liter V-8 engine that can top out at a speed of 526 horsepower. It can further reach speeds of 0-60-mph in 4.3 seconds, one of the fastest times of all pony cars in the United States. It is a two seater car, made of carbon fiber, and rear-wheel drive. It’s mileage is 14/21 mpg city/hwy. With all these features it’s no wonder the Mustang is Ford’s most popular model. ITs price is reasonable starting at $55,000 on the ford website. It is a great car that can’t be beat. Drive and enjoy!</p>
